"Markets News, March 20, 2025: Stocks Close Slightly Lower as Rebound Rally Stumbles; Accenture Plunges as Government Spending Cuts Weigh on Revenue","Spencer Platt / Getty Images
Major stock indexes closed slightly lower Thursday as the market took a breather from a recent rally, with little in the way of corporate or economic news to drive sentiment during the session.
The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down fractionally. The major indexes had gained ground in three of the previous four sessions, with Wednesday's surge coming after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and delivered its updated assessment of the economy.
The S&P 500 has gained 0.4% this week and heads into Friday's session on track to snap a four-week losing streak fueled by investor concerns about tariffs and the outlook for the economy. The Nasdaq, which has also lost ground for four consecutive weeks, is down 0.4% so far this week, while the Dow is up 1.1%.
The Fed said Wednesday that the economy continues to expand at a ""solid pace"" but that uncertainty about the outlook has increased. Members of the Fed's policy committee scaled back their growth forecasts and raised their projections for inflation. While committee members maintained their expectations for two rate cuts in 2025, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to adjust policy as it seeks clarity on the impact of Trump administration policies.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has fallen in recent months as concerns about the economy have grown, was at 4.24% in late trading, down from 4.26% at yesterday's close. The yield, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, is trading at its lowest level in more than a week.
Among the main stock movers today, Accenture (ACN) shares slid more than 7% to lead S&P 500 decliners after the professional services firm delivered a mixed earnings report and said the federal government's drive to cut costs is hurting revenue. Shares of research and advisory firm Gartner (IT), which also faces headwinds related to government efficiency measures, fell nearly 7%.
Microchip Technology (MCHP) shares fell 6.5%, leading Nasdaq decliners, as the struggling semiconductor firm moved to sell a plant in Arizona and launched a $1.35 billion convertible stock offering. IBM (IBM) shares slipped 3.6%, posting the biggest losses among Dow components.
Mega-cap technology companies, which helped lead yesterday's rally, were mixed on Thursday. Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) fell 2%, while Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was up about 1%, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and EV maker Tesla (TSLA) eked out small gains.
Investors were awaiting a handful of noteworthy earnings reports after the bell. Shares of Micron (MU) rose nearly 1% during the regular session and added another 1% in extended trading after the memory chip maker released better-than-expected results and a strong outlook. Nike (NKE) fell more than 5% in after-hours trading, despite a strong earnings report, as the sporting goods giant said that sales could take a hit under the company's turnaround plan. FedEx (FDX) also tumbled more than 5% after the bell following a disappointing quarterly report.
Gold futures were up 0.3% at $3,050 an ounce, after touching a new record high this morning, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose 1.7% to $68.30 per barrel. Bitcoin was at $84,100 in recent trading, down from an intraday high of $87,500

Markets Are Anxious, But in This Circle, Optimism Abounds
Economists, consumers, and business leaders are antsy. Wall Street analysts are bullish.
Of the 12,320 analyst ratings on S&P 500 stocks, 55.7% of them are Buy ratings, according to a recent report from FactSet Research. If that holds through the end of the month, it will represent the highest month-end percentage of Buy ratings since August 2022.
Another read: The share of Buy ratings is currently above its 5-year average (55%), according to FactSet, while the shares of Hold and Sell ratings are below their 5-year averages (39.1% and 5.9%, respectively).
The S&P 500 fell into a correction last week amid growing concerns about the Trump administration’s tariff policies and the potential they’ll raise prices and slow economic growth.
Big tech stocks have been hit particularly hard this year: The Magnificent Seven, for example, fell into a correction weeks before the S&P 500. Yet they remain among the stocks analysts are the most bullish on.
Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the S&P 500’s fourth, fifth, and sixth highest-rated stocks, respectively. Ninety-five percent of the analyst ratings on Microsoft and Amazon stocks are Buys, just slightly higher than Nvidia’s share (93%). Not a single Wall Street analyst recommends selling those stocks, according to FactSet's calculations.
The tech sector is the second-highest rated sector—63% of ratings are Buys—bested only by energy, with 65%. Meanwhile consumer staples, a traditionally defensive sector that tends to outperform when investors expect a recession, has the lowest share of Buy ratings (41%).

Cava Climbs After JPMorgan Upgrade
Cava Group (CAVA) shares jumped Thursday after the fast-casual restaurant chain's stock got an upgrade from JPMorgan analysts, expecting growth as Cava expands its locations.
The stock surged more than 4% Thursday to close at $84.66, though even with Thursday's gains, they've lost over 40% of their value since closing at a record high of of $150.88 in December.

JPMorgan analysts said they ""recommend taking advantage of the significant pullback"" in Cava's stock and boosted their rating to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" with a price target of $110, calling it a ""buy now and own for the long-term"" stock.
The analysts said they see ""significant"" space for Cava to continue expanding past its current 367 locations, potentially reaching ""well beyond"" its goal of 1,000 locations by 2032 that the company stated at the time of its initial public offering (IPO).
The consensus price target of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha is slightly higher than JPMorgan's target at about $126, suggesting significant upside from Thursday's level, though well below the stock's December high.

Jabil Stock Jumps on Strong Earnings, Outlook
Jabil shares surged to join the S&P 500's top-performing stocks Thursday after the circuit board maker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued an upbeat outlook.
The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based firm posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.94 on revenue of $6.73 billion for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected $1.81 and $6.40 billion, respectively.
""In Q2, we exceeded our expectations due to continued strength in our capital equipment, cloud and data center infrastructure, and digital commerce end-markets,"" CEO Mike Dastoor said.
For the current quarter, Jabil sees adjusted EPS between $2.08 and $2.48, and revenue of $6.7 billion to $7.3 billion, ahead of estimates. For the full year, it projects EPS of $8.95 on revenue of $27.9 billion, also topping projections amid expectations Jabil could continue to benefit from strong demand for AI.
""AI associate business is now expected to represent approximately $7.5 billion in revenue this fiscal year as demand for servers, racks, photonics, advanced networking, gear, storage and testing equipment all continue to climb higher,"" Dastoor said during the earning call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.
Jabil shares were up 3% in Thursday afternoon trading and had inched back into positive territory for 2025.

Nvidia on Track for Worst Quarter Since 2022
Mounting economic concerns have threatened to derail the AI trade, putting Nvidia (NVDA) stock on track to have its worst quarter since 2022.
Nvidia shares were down about 12.5% since the start of the quarter as of Wednesday's close. That would represent the stock's worst performance since the third quarter of 2022, when inflation was running at 8.2% and the Federal Reserve projected raising interest rates another 1.5 percentage points within the next year. (Ultimately, the central bank would lift rates even higher than forecast but, by the end of 2022, ChatGPT had sparked the AI craze that has turned Nvidia into one of the most important companies in the world.)
The third quarter of 2024 is the only quarter since 2022's bear market in which Nvidia stock has fallen, and that was a modest decline below 2%. Much of that loss came in July—as Wall Street worried about geopolitical tensions and overspending on AI infrastructure—and early August—when one of Wall Street’s favorite leveraged trades backfired, causing a flash crash of U.S. tech stocks.

Microchip Technology Stock Slides
Microchip Technology (MCHP) shares fell Thursday as the struggling semiconductor firm said it hired Macquarie Group to help sell its Fab 2 wafer fabrication plant in Arizona, and launched a $1.35 billion convertible stock offering.
Microchip Technology announced last December that it planned to offload the Tempe facility to restructure its manufacturing operations. At that time, newly installed interim CEO Steve Sanghi explained that the decision was made with ""inventory levels high and having ample capacity in place."" The site produces installed and operational chip equipment, and its product manufacturing and technologies are being transferred to Fabs 4 and 5 in Oregon and Colorado, respectively.
Michael Finley, senior vice president of fab operations, called the closure and sale ""the latest development in our ongoing restructuring, demonstrating our efforts to resize our manufacturing footprint."" The company said in December that it anticipated the shutdown would occur in the September quarter and create annual cash savings of about $90 million.
Microchip Technology has been hurt by falling demand. Last month, it reported that third-quarter fiscal 2025 net sales tumbled 42% year-over-year, with Sanghi noting that the performance reflected ""the need for the decisive steps we are taking to realign our business.""
In response to Microchip Technology's issuing the convertible stock, Moody's Ratings on Thursday downgraded its senior unsecured rating to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1."" ""The rating downgrade reflects Microchip's weak financial profile resulting from a sharp erosion in earnings,"" Moody's said.
TradingView
Microchip Technology shares were down about 5% Thursday afternoon and have lost more than 40% of their value over the last year.

Wedbush Says Musk Must Balance DOGE and Tesla CEO Duties
Long-time Tesla (TSLA) bull Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, says Elon Musk is the only one who can turn the EV maker's reputation around and the billionaire needs to show he is balancing his role working with the Department of Government Efficiency and the U.S. car maker.
Ives, along with two other Wedbush analysts, stuck with an outperform rating and $550 price target for Tesla. However, the analysts said that the company is suffering a “brand tornado crisis” due to a political backlash from Musk’s work with DOGE—the Trump administration’s cost-cutting agency.
To ""change the narrative” around the stock, Musk needs to “formally announce (he) is going to balance DOGE and being Tesla CEO,"" the analysts said. A statement like this, the analysts said, could prevent permanent brand damage for the U.S. car maker.

And another measure Musk needs to take, the analysts said, is provide investors with a ""roadmap and timing” for the lower-cost EVs that Tesla is planning this year as well as details on the rollout of unsupervised full self-driving in Austin, set for June.
""Tesla is going through a crisis and there is one person who can fix it…Musk,"" the analysts wrote.
Tesla shares have lost about half their value since hitting a record high in December, hammered by the backlash as well as investors' perception that the DOGE role is distracting Musk from running the EV maker. Tesla has also seen its sales slow in the U.S., China, and in Europe.
Tesla shares were down about 1% in recent trading.

Darden Stock Jumps as CEO Says Consumers Still Spending
Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares surged Thursday as its CEO said consumers are still spending at its establishments, outweighing news that fiscal 2025 third-quarter sales came in weaker than expected.
The parent of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.80 on net sales of $3.16 billion. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had projected $2.80 and $3.21 billion, respectively. Darden said same-restaurant sales rose 0.7% overall, including up 0.6% at Oliver Garden and 2.6% at LongHorn.
Darden kept most of its full-year outlook intact, only narrowing its adjusted EPS projection to a range of $9.45 to $9.52 from the previous $9.40 to $9.60.
Despite the downbeat quarter of sales and worsening consumer sentiment, Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said the company continues to see consumers spending.
""People, even if they say they're feeling less optimistic, we haven't seen a huge correlation between that and dining out,"" Cardenas said on Darden's earnings call. ""So changes in consumer sentiment haven't necessarily translated to material changes in consumer spending. So I think as long as incomes are going up and outpacing inflation, I think they're likely to keep spending.""
Also Thursday, the company said it is expanding its partnership with Uber (UBER), launching a pilot program of Uber Eats deliveries from 10 Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen locations.
TradingView
Darden shares were up about 5% in midday trading and were among the top gainers in the S&P 500. The stock is up 14% over the past 12 months, outpacing the performance of the S&P 500 index over that period.

Five Below Surges on Strong Results, Rosy Outlook
Five Below (FIVE) shares surged Thursday, a day after the discount retailer posted better-than-expected results and issued a rosy outlook as its holiday sales strategy paid off and it looked to open more locations.
The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.48, with net sales up 4% year-over-year to $1.39 billion. Both exceeded Visible Alpha forecasts. Same-store sales fell 3%, a smaller decline than expected.
COO Ken Bull said that the company was successful in its plan to go into the holiday season ""with the goal of showcasing more newness with key trend-right, value product, while also improving our operational execution and in-store experience.""
The company sees full-year sales from $4.21 billion to $4.33 billion, with a midpoint higher than forecasts. Five Below also looks to add about 150 new stores during the year.
Despite today’s roughly 7% gain, shares of Five Below have sunk more than 60% over the past year.

Accenture Slides Amid Concerns About Future Growth
Accenture (ACN) shares fell sharply Thursday after the professional services firm reported higher revenue but lower profit than analysts expected for its fiscal 2025 second quarter.
The stock was down 8% in recent trading, leading S&P 500 decliners, amid concerns about the company's growth prospects as the economy slows and the U.S. government reins in spending.
Accenture posted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.82 on revenue of $16.66 billion. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had projected $2.85 and $16.61 billion, respectively.
The company lifted the bottom of its full-year revenue range projection to 5% growth from 4% previously. It also raised the lower end of its EPS forecast to $12.55 from $12.43.
Ahead of Thursday's report, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies analysts cut their price targets for the stock, citing an uncertain environment among the firm's clients. Jefferies said they see Accenture's clients as having ""become a bit more cautious in the past month.""
Morgan Stanley analysts called the post-earnings environment for Accenture ""challenging"" given the Trump administration's focus on government spending cuts, along with a ""discretionary spending pullback in response to restrictive trade measures"" across the economy.

Accenture shares have lost more than 20% over the past 12 months.

Boeing Stock Price Levels to Watch After Yesterday's Surge
Boeing (BA) shares turned in their best one-day performance in nearly two years on Wednesday following bullish remarks from the plane maker’s chief financial officer, news of a new aircraft order and a favorable deliveries outlook from analysts.
The stock gained nearly 7% yesterday, leading advancers on both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. With the surge, Boeing shares narrowed their year-to-date decline to 2.5%, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 over the stretch.
After a bullish engulfing pattern marked the end of a three-week pullback in Boeing shares earlier this month, the stock has continued to trend higher, closing above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages in Wednesday’s trading session. It’s also worth pointing out the moving averages formed a golden cross early last month, a chart pattern that signals the start of a new uptrend.
Importantly, Wednesday’s move was backed by the highest volume in more than two weeks, indicating buying activity by larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has climbed back above the 50 threshold to confirm bullish price momentum.
Investors should monitor major support levels on Boeing's chart around $165 and $146, while also watching key resistance levels near $192 and $217.
Boeing shares were down slightly in premarket trading Thursday at around $172.

"Markets News, March 10, 2025: Stocks Plunge as Tariffs, Talk of Recession Dent Sentiment; Tesla Tumbles to Lead Nasdaq to Worst Day Since 2022","S&P 500 Hits Lowest Level Since September
Spencer Platt / Getty Images
Stocks plunged Monday to a six-month low amid ongoing uncertainty about the impact of policies coming from the Trump White House and concerns about the outlook for the U.S. economy.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 4%, its biggest one-day loss since September 2022, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7%, as both indexes closed at their lowest levels since last September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%, equivalent to a near-900 point decline. Stocks were coming off of gains on Friday, though they still posted steep losses for the week.
Major indexes have returned to pre-election levels as investor sentiment has been dented recently by worries about President Trump's plans for widespread tariffs and the retaliatory measures that other countries have announced. Experts say the tariffs will spark inflation, slow economic activity and harm companies that do business around the world.
Comments over the weekend from Trump that indicate his administration has a high tolerance for short-term economic disruptions and market volatility added to investor concerns. In an interview with Fox Business, Trump didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession, saying that there will be a ""period of transition"". When asked about the market's negative response to tariffs, he said: “What I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market.”
The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which has fallen significantly in recent weeks as the concerns about the economy have grown, fell to 4.22% today from 4.32% at Friday's close. The yield, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, fell as low as 4.11% last week, its lowest level since last October.
Shares of the world's largest technology companies were down across the board on Monday. EV maker Tesla (TSLA), which is riding a seven-week losing streak, slid more than 15%. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) both lost about 5%, as did chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), which had soared on Friday after a strong earnings report. Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta Platforms (META) fell 4%, while Microsoft (MSFT) was off 3% and Amazon (AMZN) gave up 2%.
Chip stocks were among the main decliners in the tech sector. Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Arm Holdings (ARM) each dropped more than 7%, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) slipped 4.6%.
Analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) and advertising platform AppLovin (APP), two of the stocks that have benefitted most from the AI investing boom of the past year, plummeted 10% and 12%, respectively.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also hit hard by fears of a possible recession. Carnival Corp. (CCL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Ralph Lauren (RL) each slid more than 5%. Financial services stocks were also down sharply amid the economic concerns, with Goldman Sachs (GS), American Express (AXP) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) all declining more than 4%.
Shares of Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy and one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin, tanked 17% as the price of the digital currency tumbled. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and online trading platform Robinhood Markets (HOOD) dropped 18% and 20%, respectively.
Bitcoin was at $79,300 in recent trading, down from a high of $91,000 on Friday. The cryptocurrency has lost ground amid investor disappointment about the details in Trump's proposal to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. The digital currency, which had surged after the election on optimism about Trump's support for the asset class, is trading near its lowest levels since mid-November,
Gold futures were down 0.6% at around $2,900 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were down 1.5% at $66.05 per barrel.
Just How Bad is the Current Sell-Off?
The S&P 500's 2.7% declne on Monday was its biggest one-day drop since December. The index has notched only two worse days in the current bull market, which began in late 2022: December 18, 2024, when the Federal Reserve scaled back its rate cut forecast, and August 5, 2024, when the unwinding of a popular leveraged trade briefly sank U.S. equities.
The last six days have been particularly punishing. The S&P 500 fell nearly 1.8% last Monday when President Trump confirmed a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports would go into effect the following day. In the five days since, stocks have fallen another 4% despite Trump again partially delaying those tariffs. The S&P 500's 5.7% decline between last Monday and today stands as the index's worst 6-day stretch since September 2022.
It’s been 340 trading days since the S&P 500 last corrected, an abnormally long time. According to research from LPL Financial, since 1929, the average time between S&P 500 corrections has been about 173 days.
Monday's sell-off brought the S&P 500 closer to a correction than any other pullback in the last year. Stocks fell about 8.4% from peak to trough during their August slump, and they retreated about 4% during their December pullback. With Monday’s losses, the S&P 500 has fallen 8.6% off its all-time high from three weeks ago.
The recent slump, however, has been a much swifter decline than the last correction, which played out over three months, from July 31 to October 27, 2023. The S&P 500 fell 10.3% in that time. It was, however, a short-lived correction; the index rebounded on October 30, the next trading day, and resumed its bull run.

Delta Sinks as Airline Cuts Outlook on Uncertain Travel Demand
Shares of Delta Air Lines dropped in extended trading hours Monday after the airline cut its sales and profit guidance for the first quarter, citing economic ""uncertainty"" that has hit demand for U.S. travel.
Delta (DAL), in an evening regulatory filing, said revenue would increase 3% to 4% and earnings per share would be 30 cents to 50 cents. Those numbers were down from a range of 7% to 9% and 70 cents to $1, respectively.
""The outlook has been impacted by the recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in domestic demand,"" the company's filling read. CEO Ed Bastian cited weakness in both corporate and consumer spending in a Monday appearance on CNBC.
""Consumers, in a discretionary business, do not like uncertainty,"" Bastian said.
Glenn Chapman / AFP / Getty Images
Delta's stock was down 12% in recent after-hour trading. The stock slid more than 5% in the regular session as consumer discretionary names were hit by growing concerns among investors about the economic outlook.
The company announced the numbers ahead of an investor conference scheduled for Tuesday morning.

Mag 7 Stocks Have Worst Day Since July
The Magnificent Seven stocks on Monday had their worst session of the year as equities sold off amid rising recession risks.
The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) fell 5.2% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since July 24. The ETF is still up 21% over the past 12 months, though it's down 20% from its record closing high in mid-December.
TradingView
Tesla (TSLA) led the Mag Seven lower, dropping 15.4% on Monday. Shares soared in the aftermath of President Trump’s victory in early November as investors bet the carmaker would benefit from CEO Elon Musk’s proximity to the president. But the stock has come under pressure since Trump’s inauguration, battered by tariffs, an increasingly gloomy economic outlook, and possibly consumer backlash to Musk’s political activity. With Monday’s losses, the stock has erased its post-election gains.
Nvidia (NVDA) shares shed about 5% on Monday. Nvidia stock has slumped in recent weeks as sales and earnings growth have moderated from their breakneck pace of the last two years. Investors are also increasingly concerned that high-profile AI successes in China could prompt the government to tighten export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and other AI hardware, a headwind to Nvidia’s sales.
Shares of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta Platforms (META) were each down more than 4%, while Microsoft (MSFT) slid more than 3% and Amazon (AMZN) lost more than 2%.
Smaller tech stocks that soared last year on AI enthusiasm also hit hard on Monday. Shares of AI plays Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP) fell 10% and 12%, respectively. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG), which got a boost last year from surging demand for low-carbon electricity from AI data centers, declined about 5%.

Could Wobbly Consumer Sentiment Undercut Economy?
Consumer spending has supported the economy's recovery from the pandemic, but worries about cost increases may erode optimism.
In February, consumers anticipated inflation would worsen over the next 12 months, projecting an increase of a tenth of a percentage point to 3.1%, according to the New York Federal Reserve's survey of consumers.
It’s the latest signal that consumers are beginning to feel worse about the economy. Various measures of consumer sentiment have declined as President Donald Trump has moved to implement tariffs—which could be a problem for the economy.
“The deterioration in confidence could very well lead businesses to pare or at least delay investments and new hires, consumers to delay purchases, and for financial risk assets, such as equities, to decline or increase in volatility,"" wrote Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.
Consumer spending makes up about 70% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the economy's growth. Shoppers have helped support the economy through inflation spikes and subsequent interest rate hikes, as shoppers kept up their momentum through most of 2024.
Data indicate some consumers were already watching their wallets before Trump implemented tariffs. If consumer surveys prove true and everyday Americans are concerned about the future of the economy, they could cut back on spending and, in turn, slow economic growth.
BMO Capital Markets Chief Economist Douglas Porter wrote that GDP in the first quarter could dip to 1% because of tariff talk. That's significantly lower than the 2.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.
“Part of the negative impact on economic activity stems from the drop in business, consumer and investor confidence, as the consensus view was that tariffs would be used as a threat and negotiating tool instead of being implemented,” Bostjancic said

Palantir Shares Slide Again, Down 40% from Record High
Palantir (PLTR) shares plummeted again Monday, extending a sharp decline that has taken place since the stock hit an all-time high last month.
The analytics software company’s stock was down 11% in late trading and was among the leading decliners on the S&P 500. Shares have lost nearly 40% over their value since recording an all-time closing high on Feb. 18.
However, Goldman Sachs analysts said late last week that they expect Palantir could be among the fastest-growing companies in terms of AI-enabled  revenue over the next two years. Despite the recent market pullback, “we expect continued technological progress and earnings growth will eventually lead investors to reengage with AI-exposed stocks,” the analysts said.
Also last week, William Blair analysts suggested Palantir could be uniquely positioned to support efforts to trim government spending directed by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. The analysts said they expect Palantir’s AI offerings to be ""platforms of choice” for federal agencies creating centralized payment tracking systems.
TradingView
Even after its recent run of losses, Palantir's stock price has almost tripled in value over the past 12 months. The stock is roughly flat since the start of 2025.

Apple Delay of AI Siri Features Could Dent iPhone Sales
Apple’s (AAPL) decision to delay the rollout of certain AI-driven Siri features could hold back iPhone sales, analysts at Citi said Monday.
A more powerful Siri with “on-screen awareness, personal context and deep app integration” could have been a driver of iPhone sales this year if it had come out this spring, the analysts said.
However, Apple said Friday it expects the updates to its voice assistant to be released later, sometime “in the coming year.” As a result, Citi now projects iPhone sales to grow 2% to 232 million units in 2025, down from 5%.
Still, the analysts kept their “buy” rating and $275 price target for Apple's stock, above the consensus target of $255 compiled by Visible Alpha. They pointed in part to “progress in rolling out Apple Intelligence in China,” where it has so far been unavailable. Apple has touted Apple Intelligence as a driver of record iPhone upgrades, with the new iPhone 16 performing better in markets where the service is available.
TradingView
Apple shares slid nearly 6% to about $225 in late trading Monday amid a widespread market selloff. Even with its recent selloff, the stock has added close to a third of its value over the past 12 months, far outpacing the performance of the S&P 500 over the period.
-Andrew Kessel
Consumer Staples Could Continue to Attract Investors
Investors who have lately turned to consumer staples as a defense against volatility may do so for a while, UBS analysts said.
The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), which tracks staples companies, has outperformed the S&P 500 since late February, rising more than 5% over the past month as the broader index fell. XLP includes businesses that manufacture and sell food, beverages and other household goods, which can appeal to investors seeking to hedge against uncertainty.
A “flight to safety” isn’t surprising, UBS analysts said, despite concerns that strong revenue in the sector may no longer be a given. Spending trends have moderated in recent weeks, which could be a reaction to poor weather and other temporary dynamics—or a sign of “things to come,” the analysts wrote Monday.
That said, other trends—including some lower commodity prices and a weakening dollar—may shore up bottom lines, the analysts wrote in another recent note.
Investor enthusiasm for the sector is unlikely to wane ""with many now believing that as long as volatility/uncertainty persists in the market, there will be greater interest in Staples irrespective of fundamentals,"" UBS analysts wrote Friday.
Staples stocks were among few S&P 500 sectors gaining on Monday amid the broader, tech-led sell-off. The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM), which sells ingredients for human and pet food, was up 3% in recent trading; Brown Forman (BF.B), the company behind Jack Daniel’s, added 2%; and McCormick & Co. (MKC), known for spices and sauces, rose 2%.

What Analysts Think of Oracle Ahead of Earnings Late Monday
Oracle (ORCL) is set to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market closes today with analysts watching for revenue growth and possible commentary on the company's Stargate joint venture.
Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, eight have “buy” or equivalent ratings, with six giving the stock a “hold” rating. Their consensus price target is near $194, representing an upside of more than 30% from the stock's current level.
Oracle shares were down 5% in recent trading amid the broader tech-led sell-off for U.S. equities on Monday.
The cloud services giant is expected to report fiscal first-quarter revenue of $14.37 billion, up around 8% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings are expected to land at $4.29 billion, or $1.49 per share, up from $3.98 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier.
UBS analysts said they will be watching for commentary on Stargate, Oracle's joint venture with OpenAI and SoftBank. Information on the up to $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure project ""has the potential to outweigh everything else"" from Oracle's earnings call, the analysts said. UBS maintained a ""buy"" rating and $210 price target.
""Sentiment has been incrementally more positive post the [Jan. 21] Stargate announcement,"" Jefferies analysts said recently, reiterating a price target of $220.

Shares of Oracle are down this year but up about 30% over the past 12 months.

Tesla Shares Down 50% From December Record High
Tesla (TSLA) shares plummeted on Monday and have given up more than half their value since hitting an all-time high in mid-December.
With today's decline, the stock is below its closing level on Election Day (Nov. 5). Tesla shares soared in the wake of Donald Trump's election as investors placed bets that CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with the president would benefit the EV maker.
Since Trump took office in January and Musk started working in the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, shares have tumbled. They have been pressured by weak fourth-quarter deliveries and earnings, uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, and declining sales in China and registrations in Europe to start the year. Increasingly, investors have wondered whether Musk's DOGE involvement could hurt Tesla's brand and sales going forward.
Analysts remain divided on the stock, with the 19 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha split between 10 ""buy,"" five ""hold,"" and four ""sell"" ratings.
UBS analysts on Monday maintained their ""sell"" rating and lowered their price target to $225 from $259, and cut their estimates for first-quarter deliveries to 367,000 from 437,000 previously. They said the new Model Y and a yet-to-be-announced lower cost model will likely help sales, but see demand for the new Model Y as ""somewhat muted"" so far, and expect a lower-cost vehicle to come with a lower margin.
Tesla shares recently were down 12% at around $232. The stock is down 52% from its all-time closing high of $479.86, set on Dec. 17.
TradingView
Tesla stock is down 43% so far in 2025, making it the biggest decliner among the Magnificent Seven group of major tech companies.

DexCom Drops as Diabetes Device Maker Gets FDA Warning
Shares of DexCom (DXCM) sank Monday morning after the maker of glucose monitoring devices reported it had received a warning letter from federal regulators over the condition of two of its manufacturing plants.
The company said the letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) noted ""deficiencies in the response"" from DexCom to the FDA's Form 483, which outlines observations from investigators.
The company noted the FDA held inspections of its San Diego, Calif., and Mesa, Ariz., facilities last year, which found ""non-conformities in manufacturing processes and quality management system.""
DexCom said that it has ""already submitted several responses to the Form 483 and is in the process of preparing a written response to the warning letter."" It added that it plans ""to continue to undertake certain corrections and corrective actions,"" although cannot guarantee the FDA will be satisfied with the response by the deadline regulators have set.
The company pointed out that its operations are not being affected and it sees no material impact from the warning letter.
DexCom shares were down 7% recently and have lost about 45% of their value over the past year.

Novo Nordisk Drops on Latest Weight-Loss Drug Study
Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares fell Monday morning following the release of data for a new phase 3 clinical trial of its in-development weight loss drug CagriSema.
In the second phase 3 study for the combination drug, the average weight loss among the roughly 1,200 patients in the study who took CagriSema was 15.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks, compared to 3.1% for those taking a placebo.
The study from the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy follows the first Phase 3 trial results for CagriSema in December that saw patients lose 22.7% of their body weight. Shares sank 17% following that study, as Bloomberg had reported ahead of the results that Novo Nordisk was aiming for a 25% weight loss with the new drug.
Novo Nordisk still has two more Phase 3 trials scheduled for CagriSema, and said Monday it still expects to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the first quarter of 2026.
TradingView
Shares of the Danish drugmaker were down 9% in recent trading. While shares had risen recently following other trial results and solid sales of its current weight loss drugs, they are down 40% over the past 12 months.

Redfin Stock Soars on Deal with Rocket Companies
Redfin (RDFN) shares soared in early trading Monday after mortgage giant Rocket Companies (RKT) announced it was buying the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion.
Rocket said the transaction values Redfin shares at $12.50 each and ""connects Redfin's nearly 50 million monthly visitors to Rocket's mortgage products.""
Redfin shares were up 74% at $10.15 in the opening minutes of today's session. Shares of the Detroit-based Rocket were down 11%.
Rocket said it ""expects the combined company to achieve more than $200 million in run-rate synergies by 2027,"" and that the deal is expected to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by the end of 2026. Once the transaction closes, current Rocket shareholders will control 95% of the combined firm, while Redfin shareholders will own the rest.
""Together, we will improve the experience by connecting traditionally disparate steps of the search and financing process with leading technology that removes friction, reduces costs and increases value to American homebuyers,"" Rocket Companies CEO Varun Krishna said.
Entering Monday, Rocket Companies shares had added nearly a quarter of their value over the past 12 months, while Redfin stock had lost about 18% of its value in that span.

Major Indexes Have Given Back Their Post-Election Gains
The post-election gains that U.S. stocks registered have evaporated during the recent slump.
Stocks hit a series of record highs in the weeks that followed the presidential election amid optimism surrounding President Trump's pro-business agenda, amid expectations for higher levels of investment, lower taxes and a reduction in regulatory barriers. In recent weeks, however, concerns about Trump's plans for tariffs—and the on-again, off-again nature of the announcements—have roiled markets.
The S&P 500 is down more than 6% from its record high set on Feb. 19 and has lost ground in each of the last three weeks. The Nasdaq is down nearly 10% from its record high set in mid-December. Both of the indexes last week dropped below the levels they were at on the Nov. 5 election day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average enters Monday's session 1.4% above its close on election day, though futures indicate that the blue-chip index will fall to about that level this morning.

Best Energy Stocks to Watch in March 2025,"These are some of the best-performing stocks in the energy sector over the past month
Yui Mok - PA Images/Getty Images
Companies in the energy sector explore for and develop oil and gas products, provide consolidated utility services, and discover and market renewable energy sources, among other things. The energy market is massive and likely to only grow as demand surges. However, large-scale shifts away from the traditional fossil fuel portion of the sector have prompted even stalwart energy firms to pivot in recent years.
We've compiled the best energy stocks to watch for March 2025 based on 30-day returns. Other factors included in our screen can be found in the detailed explanation of our ranking methodology below. All data are current as of Feb. 21, 2025.
As a group, energy stocks rose throughout fall 2024, spiking after the U.S. presidential election and falling toward the end of the year. In the last month, they have been uncommonly volatile, moving up and down quickly multiple times alongside geopolitical uncertainty both domestic and international. Generally, energy stock prices often move in tandem with energy prices. For example, in 2022, amid the initial months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy prices peaked and many companies in the sector also experienced gains.
Production levels around the world are an essential factor in the performance of energy sector stocks. U.S. oil production is expected to increase under President Trump, although it has been at a high level for some time prior to the new administration. On the other hand, some OPEC+ countries have capped production. Analysts expect demand for energy products to continue to grow, driven by factors including increased reliance on high-usage services like cloud and artificial intelligence, among other things.
We screened for the best energy stocks by looking at all energy companies trading on either the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. From there, we included companies with a share price of at least $5, with daily trading volumes of 100,000 or more, and with a market capitalization of $300 million or higher. This is to ensure that our screen includes established firms in the energy industry.
Next, we ranked the remaining energy companies by 30-day return and identified the top-performing stocks based on that metric. We excluded any companies with negative returns during that period. Our screen includes stocks of energy companies and does not include products utilized directly in energy trading.
In our list, several of the stocks do not include a P/E ratio. This may be the case when a company has posted losses in the period in question or in the prior year period, making it impossible to calculate a P/E ratio.
The energy market is both gargantuan and growing, providing a significant potential benefit to investors. The global energy market is valued at about $6 trillion. Due to continued demand for energy to power factories, machinery, cars, and much more, companies are able to take part in the energy sector in many ways. This provides investors a range of options from which to choose within this large sector, including companies focused on energy production, transportation, distribution, storage, and more. Energy companies also exist in both traditional and more experimental corners of the market.
Demand for energy products is only likely to increase, and this is likely to drive growth in the size of the market into the future. The U.N. anticipates a global investment of $2.4 trillion per year over the coming decade in order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Renewable energy sources are becoming more popular and commonplace globally, offering investors a greater degree of variety in terms of the types of energy investment opportunities they experience.
There are also some important disadvantages and risks associated with energy sector investment. Fundamentally, many energy companies are heavily dependent upon the price of energy products; a crash in the market could be devastating, and even day-to-day volatility can make investing a challenge. As a highly complex, global market, energy can be difficult to assess for investors looking to identify strong options.
Further, many companies in the energy sector use products and practices that contribute significantly to climate change. Investors seeking companies with a strong history of meeting ESG standards may be limited in their approach in the energy sector.
While the stocks above are at the top of our list for this month, it's important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future returns.
Energy sector companies include those focused on hydrocarbons, renewable energy, some utilities firms, and much more. Because they are often closely linked to the price of oil and other energy products, their share prices may be volatile. But the size of the market and the expectation of future growth make energy an enticing prospect for many investors.

"Markets News, March 10, 2025: Stocks Plunge as Tariffs, Talk of Recession Dent Sentiment; Tesla Tumbles to Lead Nasdaq to Worst Day Since 2022","S&P 500 Hits Lowest Level Since September
Spencer Platt / Getty Images
Stocks plunged Monday to a six-month low amid ongoing uncertainty about the impact of policies coming from the Trump White House and concerns about the outlook for the U.S. economy.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 4%, its biggest one-day loss since September 2022, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7%, as both indexes closed at their lowest levels since last September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%, equivalent to a near-900 point decline. Stocks were coming off of gains on Friday, though they still posted steep losses for the week.
Major indexes have returned to pre-election levels as investor sentiment has been dented recently by worries about President Trump's plans for widespread tariffs and the retaliatory measures that other countries have announced. Experts say the tariffs will spark inflation, slow economic activity and harm companies that do business around the world.
Comments over the weekend from Trump that indicate his administration has a high tolerance for short-term economic disruptions and market volatility added to investor concerns. In an interview with Fox Business, Trump didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession, saying that there will be a ""period of transition"". When asked about the market's negative response to tariffs, he said: “What I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market.”
The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which has fallen significantly in recent weeks as the concerns about the economy have grown, fell to 4.22% today from 4.32% at Friday's close. The yield, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, fell as low as 4.11% last week, its lowest level since last October.
Shares of the world's largest technology companies were down across the board on Monday. EV maker Tesla (TSLA), which is riding a seven-week losing streak, slid more than 15%. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) both lost about 5%, as did chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), which had soared on Friday after a strong earnings report. Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta Platforms (META) fell 4%, while Microsoft (MSFT) was off 3% and Amazon (AMZN) gave up 2%.
Chip stocks were among the main decliners in the tech sector. Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Arm Holdings (ARM) each dropped more than 7%, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) slipped 4.6%.
Analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) and advertising platform AppLovin (APP), two of the stocks that have benefitted most from the AI investing boom of the past year, plummeted 10% and 12%, respectively.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also hit hard by fears of a possible recession. Carnival Corp. (CCL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Ralph Lauren (RL) each slid more than 5%. Financial services stocks were also down sharply amid the economic concerns, with Goldman Sachs (GS), American Express (AXP) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) all declining more than 4%.
Shares of Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy and one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin, tanked 17% as the price of the digital currency tumbled. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and online trading platform Robinhood Markets (HOOD) dropped 18% and 20%, respectively.
Bitcoin was at $79,300 in recent trading, down from a high of $91,000 on Friday. The cryptocurrency has lost ground amid investor disappointment about the details in Trump's proposal to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. The digital currency, which had surged after the election on optimism about Trump's support for the asset class, is trading near its lowest levels since mid-November,
Gold futures were down 0.6% at around $2,900 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were down 1.5% at $66.05 per barrel.
Just How Bad is the Current Sell-Off?
The S&P 500's 2.7% declne on Monday was its biggest one-day drop since December. The index has notched only two worse days in the current bull market, which began in late 2022: December 18, 2024, when the Federal Reserve scaled back its rate cut forecast, and August 5, 2024, when the unwinding of a popular leveraged trade briefly sank U.S. equities.
The last six days have been particularly punishing. The S&P 500 fell nearly 1.8% last Monday when President Trump confirmed a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports would go into effect the following day. In the five days since, stocks have fallen another 4% despite Trump again partially delaying those tariffs. The S&P 500's 5.7% decline between last Monday and today stands as the index's worst 6-day stretch since September 2022.
It’s been 340 trading days since the S&P 500 last corrected, an abnormally long time. According to research from LPL Financial, since 1929, the average time between S&P 500 corrections has been about 173 days.
Monday's sell-off brought the S&P 500 closer to a correction than any other pullback in the last year. Stocks fell about 8.4% from peak to trough during their August slump, and they retreated about 4% during their December pullback. With Monday’s losses, the S&P 500 has fallen 8.6% off its all-time high from three weeks ago.
The recent slump, however, has been a much swifter decline than the last correction, which played out over three months, from July 31 to October 27, 2023. The S&P 500 fell 10.3% in that time. It was, however, a short-lived correction; the index rebounded on October 30, the next trading day, and resumed its bull run.

Delta Sinks as Airline Cuts Outlook on Uncertain Travel Demand
Shares of Delta Air Lines dropped in extended trading hours Monday after the airline cut its sales and profit guidance for the first quarter, citing economic ""uncertainty"" that has hit demand for U.S. travel.
Delta (DAL), in an evening regulatory filing, said revenue would increase 3% to 4% and earnings per share would be 30 cents to 50 cents. Those numbers were down from a range of 7% to 9% and 70 cents to $1, respectively.
""The outlook has been impacted by the recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in domestic demand,"" the company's filling read. CEO Ed Bastian cited weakness in both corporate and consumer spending in a Monday appearance on CNBC.
""Consumers, in a discretionary business, do not like uncertainty,"" Bastian said.
Glenn Chapman / AFP / Getty Images
Delta's stock was down 12% in recent after-hour trading. The stock slid more than 5% in the regular session as consumer discretionary names were hit by growing concerns among investors about the economic outlook.
The company announced the numbers ahead of an investor conference scheduled for Tuesday morning.

Mag 7 Stocks Have Worst Day Since July
The Magnificent Seven stocks on Monday had their worst session of the year as equities sold off amid rising recession risks.
The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) fell 5.2% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since July 24. The ETF is still up 21% over the past 12 months, though it's down 20% from its record closing high in mid-December.
TradingView
Tesla (TSLA) led the Mag Seven lower, dropping 15.4% on Monday. Shares soared in the aftermath of President Trump’s victory in early November as investors bet the carmaker would benefit from CEO Elon Musk’s proximity to the president. But the stock has come under pressure since Trump’s inauguration, battered by tariffs, an increasingly gloomy economic outlook, and possibly consumer backlash to Musk’s political activity. With Monday’s losses, the stock has erased its post-election gains.
Nvidia (NVDA) shares shed about 5% on Monday. Nvidia stock has slumped in recent weeks as sales and earnings growth have moderated from their breakneck pace of the last two years. Investors are also increasingly concerned that high-profile AI successes in China could prompt the government to tighten export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and other AI hardware, a headwind to Nvidia’s sales.
Shares of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta Platforms (META) were each down more than 4%, while Microsoft (MSFT) slid more than 3% and Amazon (AMZN) lost more than 2%.
Smaller tech stocks that soared last year on AI enthusiasm also hit hard on Monday. Shares of AI plays Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP) fell 10% and 12%, respectively. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG), which got a boost last year from surging demand for low-carbon electricity from AI data centers, declined about 5%.

Could Wobbly Consumer Sentiment Undercut Economy?
Consumer spending has supported the economy's recovery from the pandemic, but worries about cost increases may erode optimism.
In February, consumers anticipated inflation would worsen over the next 12 months, projecting an increase of a tenth of a percentage point to 3.1%, according to the New York Federal Reserve's survey of consumers.
It’s the latest signal that consumers are beginning to feel worse about the economy. Various measures of consumer sentiment have declined as President Donald Trump has moved to implement tariffs—which could be a problem for the economy.
“The deterioration in confidence could very well lead businesses to pare or at least delay investments and new hires, consumers to delay purchases, and for financial risk assets, such as equities, to decline or increase in volatility,"" wrote Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.
Consumer spending makes up about 70% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the economy's growth. Shoppers have helped support the economy through inflation spikes and subsequent interest rate hikes, as shoppers kept up their momentum through most of 2024.
Data indicate some consumers were already watching their wallets before Trump implemented tariffs. If consumer surveys prove true and everyday Americans are concerned about the future of the economy, they could cut back on spending and, in turn, slow economic growth.
BMO Capital Markets Chief Economist Douglas Porter wrote that GDP in the first quarter could dip to 1% because of tariff talk. That's significantly lower than the 2.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.
“Part of the negative impact on economic activity stems from the drop in business, consumer and investor confidence, as the consensus view was that tariffs would be used as a threat and negotiating tool instead of being implemented,” Bostjancic said

Palantir Shares Slide Again, Down 40% from Record High
Palantir (PLTR) shares plummeted again Monday, extending a sharp decline that has taken place since the stock hit an all-time high last month.
The analytics software company’s stock was down 11% in late trading and was among the leading decliners on the S&P 500. Shares have lost nearly 40% over their value since recording an all-time closing high on Feb. 18.
However, Goldman Sachs analysts said late last week that they expect Palantir could be among the fastest-growing companies in terms of AI-enabled  revenue over the next two years. Despite the recent market pullback, “we expect continued technological progress and earnings growth will eventually lead investors to reengage with AI-exposed stocks,” the analysts said.
Also last week, William Blair analysts suggested Palantir could be uniquely positioned to support efforts to trim government spending directed by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. The analysts said they expect Palantir’s AI offerings to be ""platforms of choice” for federal agencies creating centralized payment tracking systems.
TradingView
Even after its recent run of losses, Palantir's stock price has almost tripled in value over the past 12 months. The stock is roughly flat since the start of 2025.

Apple Delay of AI Siri Features Could Dent iPhone Sales
Apple’s (AAPL) decision to delay the rollout of certain AI-driven Siri features could hold back iPhone sales, analysts at Citi said Monday.
A more powerful Siri with “on-screen awareness, personal context and deep app integration” could have been a driver of iPhone sales this year if it had come out this spring, the analysts said.
However, Apple said Friday it expects the updates to its voice assistant to be released later, sometime “in the coming year.” As a result, Citi now projects iPhone sales to grow 2% to 232 million units in 2025, down from 5%.
Still, the analysts kept their “buy” rating and $275 price target for Apple's stock, above the consensus target of $255 compiled by Visible Alpha. They pointed in part to “progress in rolling out Apple Intelligence in China,” where it has so far been unavailable. Apple has touted Apple Intelligence as a driver of record iPhone upgrades, with the new iPhone 16 performing better in markets where the service is available.
TradingView
Apple shares slid nearly 6% to about $225 in late trading Monday amid a widespread market selloff. Even with its recent selloff, the stock has added close to a third of its value over the past 12 months, far outpacing the performance of the S&P 500 over the period.

Consumer Staples Could Continue to Attract Investors
Investors who have lately turned to consumer staples as a defense against volatility may do so for a while, UBS analysts said.
The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), which tracks staples companies, has outperformed the S&P 500 since late February, rising more than 5% over the past month as the broader index fell. XLP includes businesses that manufacture and sell food, beverages and other household goods, which can appeal to investors seeking to hedge against uncertainty.
A “flight to safety” isn’t surprising, UBS analysts said, despite concerns that strong revenue in the sector may no longer be a given. Spending trends have moderated in recent weeks, which could be a reaction to poor weather and other temporary dynamics—or a sign of “things to come,” the analysts wrote Monday.
That said, other trends—including some lower commodity prices and a weakening dollar—may shore up bottom lines, the analysts wrote in another recent note.
Investor enthusiasm for the sector is unlikely to wane ""with many now believing that as long as volatility/uncertainty persists in the market, there will be greater interest in Staples irrespective of fundamentals,"" UBS analysts wrote Friday.
Staples stocks were among few S&P 500 sectors gaining on Monday amid the broader, tech-led sell-off. The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM), which sells ingredients for human and pet food, was up 3% in recent trading; Brown Forman (BF.B), the company behind Jack Daniel’s, added 2%; and McCormick & Co. (MKC), known for spices and sauces, rose 2%.

What Analysts Think of Oracle Ahead of Earnings Late Monday
Oracle (ORCL) is set to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market closes today with analysts watching for revenue growth and possible commentary on the company's Stargate joint venture.
Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, eight have “buy” or equivalent ratings, with six giving the stock a “hold” rating. Their consensus price target is near $194, representing an upside of more than 30% from the stock's current level.
Oracle shares were down 5% in recent trading amid the broader tech-led sell-off for U.S. equities on Monday.
The cloud services giant is expected to report fiscal first-quarter revenue of $14.37 billion, up around 8% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings are expected to land at $4.29 billion, or $1.49 per share, up from $3.98 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier.
UBS analysts said they will be watching for commentary on Stargate, Oracle's joint venture with OpenAI and SoftBank. Information on the up to $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure project ""has the potential to outweigh everything else"" from Oracle's earnings call, the analysts said. UBS maintained a ""buy"" rating and $210 price target.
""Sentiment has been incrementally more positive post the [Jan. 21] Stargate announcement,"" Jefferies analysts said recently, reiterating a price target of $220.

Shares of Oracle are down this year but up about 30% over the past 12 months.

Tesla Shares Down 50% From December Record High
Tesla (TSLA) shares plummeted on Monday and have given up more than half their value since hitting an all-time high in mid-December.
With today's decline, the stock is below its closing level on Election Day (Nov. 5). Tesla shares soared in the wake of Donald Trump's election as investors placed bets that CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with the president would benefit the EV maker.
Since Trump took office in January and Musk started working in the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, shares have tumbled. They have been pressured by weak fourth-quarter deliveries and earnings, uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, and declining sales in China and registrations in Europe to start the year. Increasingly, investors have wondered whether Musk's DOGE involvement could hurt Tesla's brand and sales going forward.
Analysts remain divided on the stock, with the 19 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha split between 10 ""buy,"" five ""hold,"" and four ""sell"" ratings.
UBS analysts on Monday maintained their ""sell"" rating and lowered their price target to $225 from $259, and cut their estimates for first-quarter deliveries to 367,000 from 437,000 previously. They said the new Model Y and a yet-to-be-announced lower cost model will likely help sales, but see demand for the new Model Y as ""somewhat muted"" so far, and expect a lower-cost vehicle to come with a lower margin.
Tesla shares recently were down 12% at around $232. The stock is down 52% from its all-time closing high of $479.86, set on Dec. 17.

DexCom Drops as Diabetes Device Maker Gets FDA Warning
Shares of DexCom (DXCM) sank Monday morning after the maker of glucose monitoring devices reported it had received a warning letter from federal regulators over the condition of two of its manufacturing plants.
The company said the letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) noted ""deficiencies in the response"" from DexCom to the FDA's Form 483, which outlines observations from investigators.

DexCom said that it has ""already submitted several responses to the Form 483 and is in the process of preparing a written response to the warning letter."" It added that it plans ""to continue to undertake certain corrections and corrective actions,"" although cannot guarantee the FDA will be satisfied with the response by the deadline regulators have set.
The company pointed out that its operations are not being affected and it sees no material impact from the warning letter.
DexCom shares were down 7% recently and have lost about 45% of their value over the past year.

In the second phase 3 study for the combination drug, the average weight loss among the roughly 1,200 patients in the study who took CagriSema was 15.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks, compared to 3.1% for those taking a placebo.

Major Indexes Have Given Back Their Post-Election Gains
The post-election gains that U.S. stocks registered have evaporated during the recent slump.
Stocks hit a series of record highs in the weeks that followed the presidential election amid optimism surrounding President Trump's pro-business agenda, amid expectations for higher levels of investment, lower taxes and a reduction in regulatory barriers. In recent weeks, however, concerns about Trump's plans for tariffs—and the on-again, off-again nature of the announcements—have roiled markets.
The S&P 500 is down more than 6% from its record high set on Feb. 19 and has lost ground in each of the last three weeks. The Nasdaq is down nearly 10% from its record high set in mid-December. Both of the indexes last week dropped below the levels they were at on the Nov. 5 election day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average enters Monday's session 1.4% above its close on election day, though futures indicate that the blue-chip index will fall to about that level this morning.
